He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41002008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, <span class=\"woc\">“Why do you question these things in your hearts?</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v41002009-1\">9&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise, take up your bed and walk’?</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v41002010-1\">10&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</span>—he said to the paralytic—<b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v41002011-1\">11&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">“I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.”</span> <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41002012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”</p>\n"
