    "All of us long for a hero to follow. A champion. Someone who will fight for us, give us meaning and purpose, and provide hope for the future. They might be a politician, a sportsperson, a family member or friend. They might even be ourselves.",
    "But time and again, these 'heroes' fail to deliever. They let us down. What if there was a better hero?",
    "What if there was someone who provided true meaning and purpose, who was able to save us from our biggest problem of all, and provide us with lasting hope?",
    "In the pages of Mark's Gospel we read about the historical account of the life of Jesus.",
    "These four short studies have been designed for you to do with a friend so that you can find more about who Jesus is and why he came. In each conversation you’ll look at a different passage from Mark’s Gospel and be given three conversation starters to examine what Mark says and discover a better hero."
